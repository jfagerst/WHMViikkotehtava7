### Retrieving data from API

What should I play next? This is a mobile app for finding something new to play. Just choose a platform and genre and you're all set! 

Data is retrieved from RAWG Video Games Database.


#### Here is the full discription of assignment:

Create a mobile app based on your own idea/topic that retrieves data from free API (open data). List of available APIs is available, for example, on https://apilist.fun, but basically you can use whatever API you prefer providing JSON, XML or GraphQL.

Application should contain some logic beyond just displaying simple data (random cat etc.). For example, it could be an app retrieving weather based on location (GPS or location typed by user).

Do not use any API, that requires payment (or using credit card for signup).
